## Hello, I'm Marzuka 👋

Welcome to my Github profile. I'm a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate from [Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology](https://www.ruet.ac.bd/)


## 🔬 Research Interests

My research interests span **Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing**, with a unifying focus on **representation learning**, **robustness**, and understanding **model behavior under distribution shifts** across modalities.


## 🔭 Current Focus

I'm currently collaborating with [Dr. Nur Ahmed](https://www.nurahmed.com/) in a multidisciplinary research lab. My research focuses on leveraging natural language processing (NLP) methods to analyze institutional diversity discourse from large-scale social media data, a niche but technically challenging domain within U.S. academia.


## 🎓 Undergraduate Research

My undergraduate research focused on improving the prediction of Alzheimer’s disease stages by developing a **multi-scale CNN architecture** to address the challenges of **highly imbalanced data** and a **limited number of MRI samples**. This work resulted in a [**conference publication at IEEE ICCIT 2023**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10441020).
