## Hello, I'm Marzuka 👋
Welcome to my Github profile. I'm a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate from [Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology](https://www.ruet.ac.bd/)

## 🔬 Research Interests
My research interests span **computer vision and natural language processing**, with a unifying focus on **representation learning**, **robustness**, and understanding **model behavior under distribution shifts** across modalities.

## 🔭 Current Focus: Large-Scale NLP
I'm currently collaborating with [Dr. Nur Ahmed](https://www.nurahmed.com/) in a multidisciplinary research lab. My research focuses on leveraging natural language processing (NLP) methods to analyze institutional diversity discourse from large-scale social media data, a niche but technically challenging domain within U.S. academia.
