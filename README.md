## Hello!
Welcome to my Github profile. I'm Marzuka, a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate from [Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology](https://www.ruet.ac.bd/)

My academic interests span **computer vision and natural language processing**, with a unifying focus on **representation learning**, **robustness**, and understanding **model behavior under distribution shifts** across modalities.

I am currently working as a Research Assistant under  [Dr. Nur Ahmed](https://www.nurahmed.com/) in a multidisciplinary research lab. My research here focuses on how institutions engage in diversity-related communication.
